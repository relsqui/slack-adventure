I will write some real documentation when I'm not at work. In the meantime:
* start reading from [`index.js`](index.js)
* the map is one big object in [`map.js`](map.js)
* the verification key for the slack app goes in [`example-secrets.js`](example-secrets.js), then rename it to `secrets.js`
* player data (currently only location) is stored only as long as the app is running
